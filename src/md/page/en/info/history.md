## Know the history, the project and the people.

It all started in 2017, when Fulvio, an architect, illustrator and visual artist had the idea of telling a story through his grafitti. Thanks to the MEC's Competitive Fund, we opened two years later the first story, ""Un Silencio Bárbaro"", in the Palermo neighborhood of Montevideo. More than 30 professionals and technicians (writers, Grafitti artist, musicians, animators, etc) worked for this circuit.

More than 500 downloads were made, reaching about 3,000 visits among neighbors, tourists, schools and senior citizens of the Plan Ibirapitá in a few months. In 2019 we obtained support from ANII to improve the PPP and to raise awareness of its potential in various sectors (technology, tourism and creative industries). We became known, and thus we made a new story and circuit in the city of Salto, with the Ministry of Tourism together with the Municipality of Salto for the program Corridor of the Painted Birds.

We have had repercussions in national and international media, we were qualified as a cultural and tourist experience, where children, young people and adults can experience and link with art, heritage and technology. In this section you will find some of the press releases.
