#### We have created the Booksonwall App which, with visual and sound stimuli, interacts with people, making them part of their stories, travelling around the city and visiting works of urban art.

## Manifest

We are a diverse, multidisciplinary and collaborative collective; a team of resilient creative people who promote integration, innovation and free culture. We like to have fun, to have people participate and enjoy what we do, awakening curiosity and reflection. To this end, we combine art, public spaces and technology in their various disciplines and trades.

We create stories and projects to awaken memory through art, culture and popular knowledge in order to rescue them, revalue them and make them evident by creating educational, didactic and trans-generational bridges.

Our raw material is culture and the anchorage to the fabric of each territory is why we create community beyond the borders to explore in each place the richness of its boundaries, breaking the apparent barriers.

We will create positive and unforgettable proposals with a life of their own that will generate roots, celebrate culture and also contribute to a freer, fairer and more empathetic future.

Let's enjoy this collaborative experience.

## Vision
We project ourselves as a great global collective of creation of immersive narratives linked to art and territory with the use of contemporary technologies based on collaborative creation and free culture.
